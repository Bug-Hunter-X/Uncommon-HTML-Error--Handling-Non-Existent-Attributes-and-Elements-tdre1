This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors that can occur in HTML code. The first error involves attempting to access a non-existent attribute using getAttribute.  The second error involves manipulating the style of a non-existent element.  The solution shows how to properly handle these situations by first checking for the existence of the element or attribute before attempting to access them.
